# JLCPCB_Aksharan_Unique_Christmas_PCB


> Since ,jlcpcb is conducting a Christmas PCB design Contest...so I decided to participate in the contest too :).But the thing is ,topic is christmas and there are not much options available to christmas designs.All you can see in google is "A santa","Christmas tree with Leds" and "Sleigh" in some cases.So i decided go 'out of the box' and designed something that is never done before.Hope you all like it.This is a christmas themed 12 led Arduino nano creative board . 5-12v Dc power jack is provided for supply. Code according to your pattern :).
Merry Christmas!!
